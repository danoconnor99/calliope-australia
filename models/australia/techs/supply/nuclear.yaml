# There is ambiguity in the costs and operating characteristics for nuclear power plants in the literature.
# The values we use here are based on averaging data from [Wealer:2019,IEA:2020,Barkatullah:2017].
# Another available source not used here is [BEIS:2016]. It has similar values,
# but tends towards being more optimistic in some areas (longer technology lifetime, higher average capacity factor, lower O&M costs)
# and less optimistic in others (higher investment and annual O&M cost range)
